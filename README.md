# Red-Wine-Quality-Analysis-R
This project was done as a part of data analysis nanodegree a Udacity. The intent of the project is to do an analysis 
for Red Wine Quality Data (by Cortez et al) in R. The entire analysis was done in R studio using R Markdown featur and the results 
were also downloaded and stored in a html file. 
The html report can be read as I share my line of thought and code in that.

# Data
Data was provided to me by Udacity. 
More about this is already written in the html report in the repository.
